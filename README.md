## Eisenhower Model
The Eisenhower Matrix, also referred to as Urgent-Important Matrix, helps you decide on and prioritise tasks by urgency and importance, sorting out less urgent and important tasks which you should either delegate or not do at all.

## The Pareto Principle
The Pareto principle states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. For instance, for every 80% of a program that contains an error, 20% would be a functioning code.
