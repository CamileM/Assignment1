## Eisenhower Model
The Eisenhower Matrix, also referred to as Urgent-Important Matrix, helps you decide on and prioritise tasks by urgency and importance, sorting out less urgent and important tasks which you should either delegate or not do at all.
1) Necessity +Urgent
2) Quality -Urgent
3) Deception +Importance
4) Waste -importance

## The Pareto Principle
The Pareto principle states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes. For instance, for every 80% of a program that contains an error, 20% would be a functioning code.
- The 20 ---> 80 Rule
